                <p> My name is Mario Reyes Gómez, I was born in Mexico city but my family immediately moved to Cd. Victoria Tamaulipas, where I grew up, so I consider myself to be northern, event though it doesn´t make sense. I actually lived in Mexico city for a couple of years but when I was 18 and I didn´t really like it, so I moved to Monterrey. I am 38 now and have been living here in Monterrey for 17 years, and I really like it here, except for the traffic, specially when it rains. I am the youngest of three, and my two older brothers are twins. I have a six year old son who lives with me.

            <p> I work at NIC Mexico, where we manage the .MX Country Code Top Level Domain (CCTLD) and although I started on electronic billing, now I am part of the Registry Service Unit, which is prtetty cool beacuse I started learning more about domains, web pags and technology.</p>
            <p>I like hanging out with friends, going to the movies (a lot), playing with my son, visiting my friends, and playing some videogames, although I got rid of my PS4 recently so I could get the PS4 Pro, but since I have been really busy I think I will just wait for the bootcamp to be over to game again.</p>
